# 🧠 Scripts in Macro Recorder

### A guide for someone who has never done this before

There is no programming here. No code to type. There is a list of steps you assemble with the mouse from a dropdown — like a shopping list.

Read it in order. Fifteen minutes from now you'll have a working script.

## 1. What a script actually is

Picture two machines.

**The first is a tape recorder.** You press Record, do some clicking, press Stop. Now it repeats exactly that: same movements, same clicks, same delays. Always identical. That's a **plain macro**, and it already works without any script at all.

The tape recorder has one flaw: it's **blind**. It never looks at the screen. If the game loads three seconds slower today, it clicks on schedule anyway — into empty space. The whole run is wasted.

**The second machine is a to-do list with conditions.** Something like:

> 1. Wait until the "Claim" button shows up on screen.
> 2. Press it.
> 3. Replay actions 0 through 240 of the recording.
> 4. Read how many gems I have.
> 5. If it's under 500, go back to line 1.

That's a **script**. It can **wait**, **check** and **repeat the right number of times**. And inside itself it can still replay chunks of your recording — so you don't have to click everything out by hand again.

> **The key idea:** a script doesn't replace the recording. A script **drives** the recording. You record the boring part once, then bolt "wait for this" and "repeat until that" on top.

---

## 2. Do I even need one?

The honest answer: **usually no.** You need a script only when a blind replay isn't enough.

| Your situation | Script needed? |
|---|---|
| "I need the same thing pressed 500 times" | ❌ No. Just record + **Loop playback** |
| "I need it to run 3 hours and then shut the PC down" | ❌ No. That's **⏱ Time limit** in the main window |
| "I need it to stop when the bar turns red" | ❌ No. That's **🎯 Pixel condition** |
| "The button doesn't appear at a fixed time" | ✅ **Yes.** The `Wait for` step |
| "The button is in a different place every time" | ✅ **Yes.** The `Click image` step |
| "Keep going until I have 500 gems" | ✅ **Yes.** `While` + `Read number` |
| "If an error popup appears, close it; otherwise carry on" | ✅ **Yes.** `If` / `Else` |
| "Do exactly 20 rounds, then launch another program" | ✅ **Yes.** `While` + a variable + `Run` |

If you landed in the top three rows, close this guide — you don't need it. It's all checkboxes in the main window already.

---

## 3. Your first script in five minutes

We'll build the simplest possible thing: **a macro that waits 2 seconds, then replays your recording, over and over.**

Useless? Yes. But you'll see where everything lives, and the rest gets easy.

### Step 0. Record literally anything

Press `F6`, click around for a couple of seconds, press `F6` again. The window should show something like **📦 Events: 47**.

A script works without a recording too, but the editor won't open — it has nothing to show.

### Step 1. Open the editor

In the main window expand **✂ Editor** and press **✂ Open editor**.

A separate window opens. Three tabs across the top:

```
📦 Events: 47   ⏳ Length: 3.2 s  |  [ Story ] [ Raw events ] [ Script ]
```

### Step 2. Go to the Script tab

Press **Script**. You'll see:

> No script — the macro just replays the recording

That's correct. There genuinely isn't one yet.

### Step 3. Add the first step

At the bottom there's a dropdown and an **Add** button.

1. Pick **Wait** in the dropdown.
2. Press **Add**.

A line appears:

```
  0 Wait 1000 ms
```

Below, in the inspector, there's an **Insert pause (ms)** field. Put `2000` in it — two seconds.

```
  0 Wait 2000 ms
```

### Step 4. Add the second step

1. Pick **Play events** in the dropdown.
2. Press **Add**.

```
  0 Wait 2000 ms
  1 Play events 0…46  (47/47)
```

Notice it filled in the **whole recording** — event 0 through the last one. That's what you want 90 % of the time.

### Step 5. Run it

Close the editor window (or don't, it doesn't matter) and press **▶ Play** — or `F7`.

The macro waits two seconds and replays the recording. With **Loop playback** ticked in the main window, it keeps going round.

**That's it. You wrote a script.** Everything from here is just new kinds of steps.

> 💡 If anything goes wrong, press `F9` — emergency stop. It stops everything, always.

---

## 4. Reading the script window

A line in the list looks like this:

```
  3     Click image: claim_button ≥ 0.85
  ↑ ↑   ↑
  │ │   └── what the step does
  │ └────── indent = nesting (this step is inside an If or a While)
  └──────── step number
```

What the styling means:

| Appearance | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Normal text | A normal, enabled step |
| ~~Struck-through grey~~ | The step is **disabled** — the engine skips it. Toggle the **on** checkbox |
| 🟠 Orange text | The step **can never run** — it sits after `Quit the app` |
| 🟠 `⚠ Unbalanced blocks: …` | An error: a missing `End if` or `End while` somewhere. **This script will not run at all** |

The buttons under the list:

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| Dropdown + **Add** | Inserts a new step **right after the selected one** |
| **Step from selection** | Builds a `Play events` step from the `from`/`to` range set on the **Raw events** tab |
| **▲** / **▼** | Moves the selected step up/down |
| **Delete action** | Removes the selected step |
| **on** | Temporarily disables a step without deleting it |

Below that is the **inspector** — the fields for whichever step is currently selected. `Wait` has one field, `Click image` has three, `If` has a whole condition picker.

> ⚠️ The editor is locked while recording or playing. Press `F9` first, then edit.

---

## 5. Four rules to remember

### Rule 1. Steps run top to bottom

Like reading a book. Step 0, then 1, then 2. `If` and `While` can jump elsewhere, but everything else is strictly in order.

### Rule 2. The whole script is one "round"

**Loop playback** and **Play count: N** in the main window repeat the **entire script**, first step to last.

```
Play count: 3   →   [whole script] [whole script] [whole script]
```

Don't confuse this with the `While` step, which loops **inside** a single round.

### Rule 3. No script means the normal replay

An empty script (or one where **every** step is disabled) behaves exactly like a plain macro. Nothing breaks.

### Rule 4. Some main-window settings don't apply to scripts

This matters, and it's easy to forget:

| Setting | In a script |
|---|---|
| Loop playback / Play count | ✅ Works |
| Delay between loops | ✅ Works |
| Time limit (stop after N hours) | ✅ Works |
| Speed (slider and faster/slower hotkeys) | ⚠️ Affects the `Play events` step **only** |
| Window anchoring | ⚠️ Affects `Play events` and `Click at`, but not `Click image` |
| **Timing jitter** | ❌ Ignored |
| **🎯 Pixel condition** (stop on a pixel) | ❌ Ignored — use a `pixel` condition inside the script |
| **Action when the limit is hit** (shut down, sleep…) | ❌ Ignored — the script just stops |
| **Search area only / Try other scales** | ❌ Ignored — those apply to the test button in the panel |

If you want "shut the PC down when the script finishes", use a `Run` step with the path `shutdown` and the arguments `/s /t 60`.

---

## 6. Every step: the cheat sheet

| Step | In one line |
|---|---|
| **Play events** | Replay the recording from event N to event M |
| **Wait** | Just pause for that many milliseconds |
| **Wait for** | Block until a condition becomes true (or stops being true) |
| **Click image** | Find a picture on screen and click it |
| **Click at** | Click exact coordinates |
| **Key** | Press or release a single key |
| **Set** | Put a number in a variable (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`) |
| **If** | Start of "if this is true, then…" |
| **Else** | "…otherwise…" |
| **End if** | End of the `If` block |
| **While** | Start of "repeat while this is true" |
| **End while** | End of the loop |
| **Break** | Leave the loop early |
| **Run** | Open a program, file, folder or URL |
| **Quit the app** | Close Macro Recorder itself |
| **Note** | Write text to the log file (for debugging) |
| **Read number** | Recognise a number on screen into a variable |
| **Find image** | Look for a picture and report where it is, without clicking |
| **Read text** | Recognise a rectangle into a **text** variable |
| **Get text** | Clipboard, window title, program in front or a file → variable |
| **Put text** | Variable or literal text → clipboard or file |
| **Find element** | Ask Windows for an interface element and report where it is |
| **Press element** | Press an interface element, through the application itself |
| **Click target** | Press one thing on screen, however it can be found — **start here** |
| **Wait for target** | Block until one thing on screen turns up (or goes away) |
| **Read target** | Read the words at one thing on screen into a variable |
| **Window** | Activate, minimize, move, resize, close, or wait for a window |
| **Clipboard** | Copy, paste, set, read, clear, or wait for it to change |
| **Notify** | Say something from the tray, without taking the foreground |
| **Screenshot** | Write a picture of the screen to a file |
| **Recovery / End recovery** | A block that runs when a step says it should |

---

## 7. Every step: in detail

### 🎯 Click target · Wait for target · Read target

*New in 1.6.0.* **The step to reach for first.**

Every other step above says *how* to find something: by picture, by element, by
coordinate. A target says *what*, and carries every way of finding it that was
available when you recorded — tried in order until one works.

```
Click "Start"
    1. UI element        Button, name "Start"
    2. image             rec_20260826_0342_01
    3. window-relative   Game +412,318
    4. coordinate        1245, 720
```

If the application redraws its button, the element still finds it. If the application
exposes nothing — every game does this — the picture finds it. If the window has
moved, the window-relative offset finds it. The coordinate is the last resort and is
always there, so the step never does *nothing*.

#### You do not build that list

Record with **Snip a picture at every click** switched on, stop, and press
**Analyze**. Every click you made becomes a row: what it is now, what it could be,
and a tick. **Apply the ticked suggestions** writes the script.

#### Reliability

One dropdown, and it is the whole interface to the cascade above.

| Setting | What it tries |
|---|---|
| **Maximum** | Every way that was recorded, most durable first |
| **Balanced** | The ways that survive a layout change, plus one fallback |
| **Fast** | Only the best one |

*Maximum* is the default. Use *Fast* for a step inside a tight loop, where the cost
of looking is the point and a miss is cheap.

#### The fields

- **Called** — what it says in the step list. Filled in from the element's name when
  there is one, and worth typing in when there is not: `Click "Claim"` reads better
  than `Click rec_20260826_0342_07`.
- **Ways of finding it** — the cascade, shown in the order it will actually be tried.
  Ways the reliability setting has switched off are greyed rather than hidden, so you
  can see what it left out. Add and remove them freely.
- **Ask the application to press it** — when the element is what resolved, let the
  application press its own button. Nothing moves on screen and the window need not
  be in front.
- **Time limit** — spent once around the whole cascade, not once per way.
- **If it is not there** — the same four answers as everywhere else.

#### What it writes

`<name>.method` says which way worked — `UI element`, `image`, `coordinate`. Useful
in a condition: a macro that has quietly fallen back to coordinates every night for a
week is worth knowing about.

`Read target` prefers to ask the element what it says, and reads the pixels only when
there is no element to ask.

### 🔖 Markers, and `Play events` by name

*New in 1.6.0.*

`Play events 73…184` names events by number. Delete an event in the editor and every
number stays exactly where it was — pointing at a different hundred and eleven
events. The documentation has always warned about this.

A **marker** is a name for a place in the recording. Put two down in the editor
(the 🔖 panel under the range fields), then tick **Use markers** on a `Play events`
step and choose them:

```
Play events   Start inventory → After inventory
```

Now insert, delete or crop events anywhere and the step still covers the same
actions. The numbers stay visible underneath, and they are what an older build of the
program plays — the names sit beside them, not instead of them.

The end marker names the place *after* the region: "After inventory" is not part of
it, which is how anybody would put one down.

If you delete a marker a step was using, that step keeps playing whatever it last
resolved to. That is deliberate: it is a better answer than playing nothing, or
playing everything.


### 🪟 Window

*New in 1.6.0.* Everything that can be done to a window, in one step.

**Which window** is a separate question from **what to do to it**, and the first one
has four answers:

| Find it by | Good for |
|---|---|
| **part of the title** | what this has always been. A browser tab or a document changes the title, so it is the least stable |
| **the whole title** | when the title is exact and constant |
| **the program** | `roblox` finds `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe`. Survives every title change there is |
| **the program's full path** | two copies of the same program in different folders |

**Find it again if it restarts** is on by default. A game that crashed and came back
has a different window, and a night macro should carry on rather than aim at one that
no longer exists.

**What to do:** bring to the front · minimize · maximize · restore · ⚠ close it ·
move to · resize to · centre on screen · wait until it is in front · wait until it
appears · wait until it closes.

Only the fields an action uses are shown. The three that wait use the time limit; the
two that move use the numbers.

> ⚠ **Close it** is treated as dangerous: a test run steps over it, the same way it
> steps over `Run` and `Quit the app`. It can lose somebody's work.

---

### 📋 Clipboard

*New in 1.6.0.* Copy · paste · set it to · read it into · clear it · **wait until it
changes**.

Copy and paste send Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to whatever window is in front, through the
same path as any other keystroke — so a test run suppresses them and the frame guard
applies.

**Wait until it changes** is the one with no workaround before now. It remembers what
the clipboard held when the step began and blocks until it is different, then puts
the new contents in a variable. That is how a macro knows a copy actually happened,
instead of pressing Ctrl+C and guessing at a delay.

---

### 🩹 Recovery / End recovery

*New in 1.6.0.* A block that runs when a step asks it to.

Every step that looks for something has an **If it is not there** field. It now has a
fifth answer: **run a recovery block**.

```
Click "Claim"            if it is not there → run "popup"
Log  "claimed"
Quit the app

Recovery "popup"
    Click "OK"
    Wait 500 ms
End recovery
```

When `Click "Claim"` misses, the script jumps into the block called `popup`, runs it,
comes back, and tries the click again.

**Why this is not just "retry more times."** Retrying is right when the thing was
simply not there yet. It is useless when something is *in the way* — an error box, a
login that expired, a dialog nobody expected — because looking again at the same
obstructed screen gives the same answer. A recovery block does something about the
obstruction first.

Rules, all of them checked by **Check macro**:

- Blocks are skipped in normal flow. Walking into one does not run it.
- Blocks cannot nest, and cannot sit inside an `If` or a `While`.
- A step may be recovered **three times** before the run gives up on it. The count is
  cleared when the step finally succeeds, so a loop that recovers on each turn is not
  punished for the turns before it.
- A policy naming a block nobody wrote is reported as an error — that step looks
  handled and is not.

**Create a recovery block for this step** builds the skeleton for you.

---

### 🔔 Notify · 📷 Screenshot

*New in 1.6.0.*

**Notify** shows a balloon from the tray icon. Not a message box: a message box takes
the foreground, and taking the foreground away from the thing being automated is how
a macro breaks the very run it is reporting on. Needs the tray icon switched on.

**Screenshot** writes a picture of the screen — or just the window in front — to a
file. Left empty, it goes into this run's folder beside the failure screenshots, so
everything about one run is in one place.

---

### ⌛ Adaptive waits

*New in 1.6.0.* A checkbox on `Wait for`.

Tick **Adaptive** and the step waits for as long as it has usually needed, learned
from the run history — with the number you typed still there as the ceiling. What is
learned is how long to wait *patiently*, not permission to wait for ever.

The figure is half again the average, but never less than the slowest this step has
ever been. That floor is the point: an average describes what usually happens, and a
timeout sized to what usually happens fails on the night it matters.

With fewer than five recorded runs it says nothing and your fixed number is used
exactly as before. Test runs are excluded — no input was sent, so nothing on screen
ever responded, and those timings are about nothing.

---

### 🔤 Built-in values

*New in 1.6.0.* Nine names usable in any text field, no declaring required:

`{clipboard}` · `{window.title}` · `{process.name}` · `{time}` · `{date}` ·
`{mouse.x}` · `{mouse.y}` · `{screen.width}` · `{screen.height}`

Press `Ctrl+K` and type *built-in* to insert one without remembering the spelling.

A variable of the same name wins — if you set `time` yourself, `{time}` is yours. A
name nothing recognises is left exactly as written rather than becoming an empty
string, so a typo is visible instead of silently deleting part of your text.

There is still no third kind of variable. These are all numbers or text.


### ▶ Play events

**Fields:** `from` (first event index), `to` (last event index).

Replays a slice of your recording with its original timing. This is the bridge between the tape recorder and the script.

How to find the indices:
1. Switch to the **Raw events** or **Story** tab.
2. Find the spot, read the row number on the left.
3. Or set the `from` / `to` fields at the bottom and press **Step from selection** — the numbers get filled in for you.

**Notes:**
- A freshly added step covers the **whole recording** (0 … last event).
- This is the **only** step affected by the speed slider and the faster/slower hotkeys.
- The "skip step" hotkey abandons the rest of the slice and moves on.
- If you later delete events in the editor, the indices in the step stay as they were. Check them.

---

### ⏸ Wait

**Field:** `Insert pause (ms)` — 0 to 3,600,000 (one hour).

Just waits. 1000 ms = 1 second.

**Note:** the speed slider does **not** affect this step. A 2000 ms wait is two seconds at 0.5× and at 3×.

Stop stays responsive during a wait: the engine sleeps in 15 ms slices and keeps checking whether it should quit.

---

### ⏳ Wait for

**Fields:** condition · `appears` / `disappears` · `Timeout (ms)` (default 10,000).

The most useful step in the whole set. It holds the script until something happens on screen.

- **appears** — wait until the condition becomes **true**;
- **disappears** — wait until it becomes **false** (a loading screen going away, for instance).

The condition is polled about eight times a second.

> ⚠️ **Very important:** when the timeout expires, the script does **not** stop and does **not** complain. It simply moves to the next step as if all were well (the log records `wait timed out`).
>
> So don't write this:
> ```
> 0  Wait for   image: claim  appears  (10000 ms)
> 1  Click at   (960, 540)
> ```
> If the picture never showed up, step 1 clicks anyway. Write this instead:
> ```
> 0  Wait for   image: claim  appears  (10000 ms)
> 1  If         image: claim ≥ 0.85
> 2      Click image: claim ≥ 0.85
> 3  End if
> ```

---

### 🖼 Click image

**Fields:** `Template` (file name) · threshold (0.30–1.00) · mouse button · `outlines` · **Area**.

Finds a picture on screen and clicks its **centre**.

- The template is the name of a PNG in the `templates/` folder. Both `claim_button` and `claim_button.png` work. A **folder** of that name is a set of variants — see [section 11](#11-image-templates-how-to-make-good-ones).
- If the picture is **not found**, the step quietly does nothing and the script carries on.
- There's a 30 ms gap between press and release.
- Window anchoring does **not** apply here: the coordinates come from the actual match, so they're already correct.

**Area** is the field that decides how fast this is, and it is on every image step and image condition:

| Area | What it searches | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| **whole screen** | every monitor | the default, and the slowest |
| **active window** | whatever is in front | almost always right, and much faster |
| **a rectangle** | X, Y, W, H you type | a HUD that never moves |
| **near the last match** | a margin around where this same picture was last seen | anything that stays put; falls back to the whole screen if it is not there |
| **relative to another picture** | find an *anchor* first, then a rectangle placed relative to it | a row of identical buttons, where the heading decides which one |

Measured on a 2560×1440 desktop, a full-screen step is about 111 ms; a few hundred pixels square is about 12. Everything else in this release is smaller than that difference.

**outlines** compares shapes instead of shades. Slower by one pass, and the thing to switch on when a template that used to work stops after a theme change or under a highlighted row.

How to make templates — [section 11](#11-image-templates-how-to-make-good-ones).

---

### 🖱 Click at

**Fields:** `X` · `Y` · mouse button.

Clicks exact screen coordinates, measured from the top-left corner (they can be negative on a multi-monitor setup).

Where to get the numbers: in **🎯 Pixel condition** press **🎯 Pick in 3 s** and hover the spot — X and Y land in the fields, and you can copy them across.

Window anchoring **does** apply to this step: if the window moved, the click moves with it.

> 💡 Fixed-coordinate clicking is the most fragile kind of automation there is. Prefer `Click image` when you can.

---

### ⌨ Key

**Fields:** key from the list · `press` / `release`.

Sends **one** keyboard event. Not "press and release" — one.

To type a space you need **two steps**:

```
0  Key Space press
1  Key Space release
```

For `Ctrl+C` you need **four**:

```
0  Key Ctrl press
1  Key C press
2  Key C release
3  Key Ctrl release
```

> ⚠️ Forget the release and the key stays held for the rest of the run. Emergency stop (`F9`) force-releases everything, but don't rely on it.

Thirty common keys are available: `Space`, `Enter`, `Tab`, `Esc`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, `Shift`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, arrows, `A B C D E Q R S W`, `1 2 3`, `F1 F2 F5 F8 F9`. Need something else? Record it normally and drop it in with `Play events`.

---

### 🔢 Set

**Fields:** variable name · operation (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`) · value.

Puts a number in a variable. Details in [section 9](#9-variables-the-scripts-memory).

```
Set  rounds  =   0     ← reset
Set  rounds  +=  1     ← add one
```

---

### ❓ If / Else / End if

A fork in the road. Details in [section 10](#10-blocks-if-and-while).

---

### 🔁 While / End while / Break

A loop. Details in [section 10](#10-blocks-if-and-while).

---

### 🚀 Run

**Fields:** `Path or URL` · `Arguments`.

Opens just about anything, without waiting for it to finish:

| What you type | What happens |
|---|---|
| `C:\Games\game.exe` | Launches the program |
| `notepad` | Won't work — use a full path or `notepad.exe` |
| `https://example.com` | Opens in your default browser |
| `D:\notes\plan.txt` | Opens in the default application |
| `D:\screenshots` | Opens the folder in Explorer |
| `shutdown` + arguments `/s /t 60` | Shuts the PC down in 60 seconds |

How it works internally: `.exe`, `.bat`, `.cmd` and `.com` are started directly; everything else is handed to the shell via `cmd /C start`, which is why shortcuts, documents and URLs open too. No console window flashes up.

Arguments are split on spaces. An argument containing a space (a path like `C:\My Files\a.txt`) can't be passed correctly — that's a limitation.

---

### 🛑 Quit the app

No fields. Closes Macro Recorder completely.

For the "do the job then exit" pattern:

```
...
8  If         variable  gems >= 500
9      Note: target reached, exiting
10     Quit the app
11 End if
```

> ⚠️ Anything **after** this step at the top level (not inside an `If`/`While`) will never run. The editor colours those lines orange and says: *"⚠ Steps below can never run"*.

---

### 📝 Note

**Field:** `Text`.

Does nothing at all — it just writes your line into the log file. This is the main debugging tool, see [section 13](#13-debugging-seeing-whats-going-on).

---

### 🔤 Read number

**Fields:** `Variable` · **Prep** · **Expect** · `Region` (X, Y, W, H).

Recognises the text in a screen rectangle, pulls a number out of it and stores it in a variable.

How to set the region without counting pixels:
1. In the main window expand **🔤 Text on screen**.
2. Press **🎯 Pick in 3 s**.
3. Hover the **top-left** corner of the region, wait for the countdown.
4. Hover the **bottom-right** corner, wait again.
5. It immediately shows you what it read there.
6. Go back to your script step and press **⤵ from the panel** — all four numbers get copied in.

What the number parser understands:

| On screen | In the variable |
|---|---|
| `1250` | `1250` |
| `Gems: 1,250` | `1250` |
| `1 250` | `1250` |
| `Remaining: 500.` | `500` |
| `02:34` | `154` (a clock becomes **seconds**) |
| `1:02:03` | `3723` |
| `gibberish` | `0` |

> ⚠️ If the OCR engine errors out (a region smaller than 40×40 px, for instance), the variable **keeps its old value**. Reset it with a `Set` step before the first read.

**Prep** is what is done to the pixels before the engine sees them. Windows OCR was built for documents — dark text, light paper, generous size — and it has no settings at all. Screen text is none of those, so everything that can be done has to be done to the pixels first:

| Profile | What it does | For |
|---|---|---|
| **none** | nothing but the enlargement the engine needs | text that already reads well |
| **interface** | grey, contrast pulled out to the full range | ordinary menus and labels |
| **small text** | the same, enlarged harder | text too small to have enough pixels |
| **game HUD** | grey, stretched, then cut to black and white at Otsu's threshold | a pale number over moving artwork |
| **digits** | black and white, enlarged hard | a counter on a plate |
| **try each** | walks the list and keeps the best reading | when you do not know which |

Light text on a dark panel is turned the other way round automatically — the engine was trained on documents, and reads dark-on-light markedly better.

**Expect** says what the reading is supposed to look like:

| Expect | Passes | Fails |
|---|---|---|
| **anything** | any non-empty reading | nothing |
| **whole number** | `Gems: 1,250` | `no digits here` |
| **decimal** | `12.5%` | a reading with no digits |
| **clock** | `02:34`, `1:02:03` | `1250` |
| **pattern** | what the pattern says | everything else |

A pattern is a small thing you can type: `#` one digit, `@` one letter, `?` any one character, `*` any run including none. `##:##` matches `12:34` and not `1:34`. It is deliberately not a regular expression.

**A reading that does not fit the expected format is refused, and the variable keeps its old value.** That is the point of the field: a mis-read clock is not a small error, it is a different number, and quietly writing a zero is worse than doing nothing.

It also sets `<name>.quality`, from 0 to 1: half of it is whether the format parses at all, half is how much of the reading belongs to the alphabet that format implies. A clock that came back as `O2:3A` fails the first; a clock lifted out of a sentence fails the second. With **try each**, this is also what chooses the profile.

> 💡 The **🔤 Text on screen** panel in the main window has the same two pickers and shows the fit score next to the reading, so a profile can be chosen by comparing numbers instead of squinting.

### 🔍 Find image

**Fields:** `Template` · threshold · `outlines` · **into** (a name) · **Area**.

Looks for a picture and writes down what it found. It never clicks, which is what makes it the step to use when you want to *decide* something rather than press it.

With **into** set to `target`, it fills:

| Variable | Holds |
|---|---|
| `target.found` | 1 if the score reached the threshold, 0 if it did not |
| `target.score` | the best score it saw, whether or not it passed |
| `target.x`, `target.y` | the centre of the best match |
| `target.w`, `target.h` | the size of the variant that won |

`target.score` is the useful one when a step is not matching: it tells "nothing like it on screen" (0.4) apart from "almost, lower the threshold" (0.83).

```
Find image   claim → target
If           target.found == 1
  Click at   {target.x}, {target.y}
End if
```

---

### 🔤 Read text

**Fields:** `Variable` · **Prep** · `Region` (X, Y, W, H).

The same as **Read number**, except the whole reading is kept, as text. Use it when what is on screen is a name, a status or a message rather than a quantity.

It also sets `<name>.quality` — see **Read number** below for what that number means.

---

### 📋 Get text

**Fields:** source · `into` (a variable).

| Source | What lands in the variable |
|---|---|
| **clipboard** | whatever was last copied, as text |
| **title of the window in front** | e.g. `Roblox - Level 7` |
| **program in front** | e.g. `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe` |
| **file** | the contents of a file, up to 1 MB |

---

### 📤 Put text

**Fields:** text · destination (clipboard, or a file with an *add to the end* switch).

`{name}` anywhere in the text is replaced by what that variable holds, so this is how a script keeps a log of its own:

```
Put text   "{now} run finished with {gems} gems" → C:/logs/farm.txt  (add to the end)
```

`{{` is a literal brace. A name nobody set is left as written rather than vanishing — a message that silently loses a word is much harder to diagnose than one that shows `{typo}`.

---

### 🪟 Find element

**Fields:** `Name` · `Kind` · `Id` · *in the window in front* · `into` · timeout.

Asks **Windows** what is on screen instead of looking at the pixels. Where it works it is better than everything else here: no threshold, no resolution, no theme, no language.

- **Name** is the text a screen reader would read out. Matched exactly first (ignoring case), then as a substring.
- **Kind** narrows it to `Button`, `Edit`, `Text`, `CheckBox`, `ComboBox`, `List`, `ListItem`, `MenuItem`, `Tab`, `Window`. Worth filling in: it turns a whole window into a handful of elements.
- **Id** is the identifier the application gives the control. The most reliable field there is, when the application bothers to set one.
- **timeout** keeps looking for that long. An interface still drawing itself is the normal case just after a click.

With `into` set to `elem` it fills `elem` (the control's value, or its label if it has no value), `elem.found`, `elem.name`, `elem.x`, `elem.y`, `elem.w`, `elem.h`.

> ⚠️ **It will find nothing in a game.** Unity, DirectX, OpenGL and canvas interfaces draw themselves and expose nothing to Windows. This is a feature for automating ordinary programs. The right arrangement is a cascade: element → picture → text → coordinates.

---

### 🖲 Press element

**Fields:** the same query · mouse button · *ask the app* · timeout.

Finds the element and presses it.

With **ask the app** on it uses the application's own press: nothing moves on screen, the cursor stays where it is, the window does not even have to be in front, and a control that has shifted since it was found is still the one that gets pressed. If the control offers nothing to press, the step falls back to a real click on its centre.

---

## 8. Conditions: how the macro looks at the screen

A condition is a yes/no question. Conditions are used by three steps: `Wait for`, `If` and `While`.

There are eight of them.

### 1️⃣ always

The answer is always yes. Useful for:

- `While always` — an infinite loop (leave it with `Break` or `Quit the app`);
- `If always` — temporarily "switch on" a chunk of script without rewriting the condition.

### 2️⃣ variable

**Fields:** name · comparison (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `has`) · a number **or a piece of text**.

```
While  rounds < 20
If     gems >= 500
If     window has "level"
```

A variable that was never assigned counts as **0**.

If both sides read as numbers they are compared as numbers, whichever way they are stored — a count recognised off the screen lands as text and still compares against `10`. Otherwise the comparison is textual, trimmed and case-insensitive. `has` asks about containment, as forgivingly as screen text needs.

> ⚠️ `==` on fractional numbers is a bad idea. `0.1 + 0.2` isn't exactly `0.3` in a computer. Use `>=` and `<=`.

### 3️⃣ image

**Fields:** `Template` · threshold (0.30–1.00) · **Area** · **lost below** · **stable N / M** · `outlines`.

"Is this picture on screen right now?"

- **Area** works exactly as it does on `Click image` above, and is the single biggest thing you can do for speed.
- Side effect: it fills the built-in variables `match_x`, `match_y`, `match_score` — handy for debugging.
- 0.85 is a good starting threshold. Lower means more false hits; higher and antialiasing starts breaking matches.

**lost below** is a second, lower threshold, and it is worth understanding. A score that wobbles around a single threshold — 0.79, 0.81, 0.79, 0.82 against 0.80 — reads as *four* changes of state, and a `While` acting on each of them will thrash. Set **lost below** to 0.70 and the picture appears once at 0.81 and is not lost until it drops under 0.70: one change of state instead of four. Leave it at 0 for the old all-or-nothing behaviour.

**stable N / M** wants the answer in N of the last M looks. `2 / 3` tells an object (0.82, 0.84, 0.83) from a flicker (0.83, 0.51, 0.74). Both at 0 means every look decides on its own.

Both are kept per template, not per step, so two steps watching the same picture agree about it.

### 4️⃣ pixel

**Fields:** `X` · `Y` · colour · `Tolerance` (0–255).

"Is the point (X, Y) currently this colour?"

Tolerance is ±N on each of the R, G, B channels. `20` is sensible, `0` means an exact colour only, `60` means "roughly that sort of colour".

The fastest condition by far — one pixel instead of scanning the screen. If you need to check something hundreds of times in a loop, use a pixel, not an image.

Where to get the coordinates and colour: **🎯 Pixel condition → 🎯 Pick in 3 s**.

### 5️⃣ window

**Field:** title.

"Is there a window with this title open?"

It first looks for a window whose title matches **exactly**. Failing that, it walks every visible window and takes the first one whose title **contains** what you typed (case-insensitive, first 24 characters).

So `roblox` is enough to catch `Roblox Player`.

Good for: "wait until the game has started", "if an error window is up, close it".

### 6️⃣ text

**Fields:** `Contains` · `Region` (X, Y, W, H).

"Does this word appear in this rectangle of the screen?"

The comparison is deliberately **loose**: case is ignored, extra whitespace is collapsed, punctuation is dropped. Because text recognition never returns exactly what a human reads.

So `You win!` matches a recognised `YOU  WIN !`.

> ⚠️ The slowest condition there is. Don't put it in a loop that spins hundreds of times a second.
>
> ⚠️ It uses the text recognition built into Windows. If your game isn't in English, add the language in *Windows Settings → Time & language*. Stylised game fonts read badly — check first with the **🔤 Read now** button.

It has a **Prep** picker too, and the word you are looking for doubles as the format that **try each** judges its attempts by.

### 7️⃣ process running

**Field:** name.

"Is a program with this name running?"

Matched on part of the name, without case, so `roblox` finds `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe`. Cheaper than the window condition and answers even when the program has no window yet.

### 8️⃣ element on screen

**Fields:** the same query as **Find element** above.

"Does Windows know about an interface element like this?"

One look, not a wait — `Wait for` is already a loop. Silent in anything that draws its own interface; see the warning under **Find element**.

---

## 9. Variables: the script's memory

A variable is a labelled box holding **one number**.

- You choose the name: `rounds`, `gems`, `n`, `count`.
- The value is always a number (fractions allowed). **You cannot store text.**
- An unset variable is **0**.

### Using one

Storing a value — the **Set** step:

| Operation | Effect | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `=` | Assign | `rounds = 0` |
| `+=` | Add | `rounds += 1` |
| `-=` | Subtract | `lives -= 1` |
| `*=` | Multiply | `bet *= 2` |

A value is either a **number** or a piece of **text** — the `Set` step has a picker for which. Adding text to text joins it, which is how a message is built up a piece at a time; two numbers that happen to be stored as text are still two numbers and are added.

```
Set  msg  =   "run "
Set  msg  +=  {rounds}
Set  msg  +=  " finished"
```

`{name}` in any step's text — `Note`, `Run`, `Put text`, and a text value in `Set` — is replaced by what that variable holds. `{{` is a literal brace, and a name nobody set is left as written rather than vanishing.

Checking a value — the **variable** condition:

```
While  rounds < 20
If     gems >= 500
If     title has "level"
```

### The classic counter

Three steps worth memorising:

```
0  Set  rounds = 0             ← reset before the loop
1  While  rounds < 20          ← the exit condition
2      Play events 0…46
3      Set  rounds += 1        ← ⚠️ MUST be inside the loop
4  End while
```

> ⚠️ Forget step 3 and you get an infinite loop: `rounds` stays 0 forever.

### Built-in variables

Filled in automatically whenever the script searches for something:

| Variable | Contents |
|---|---|
| `match_x` | X of the centre of the last image match |
| `match_y` | Y of the centre of the last image match |
| `match_score` | How well it matched: 0.00 … 1.00 |

Steps that name their own prefix fill more. `Find image → target` gives `target.found`, `target.score`, `target.x`, `target.y`, `target.w`, `target.h`; `Find element → elem` gives `elem` itself plus `elem.found`, `elem.name` and the same four numbers; `Read number → gold` and `Read text → line` add `gold.quality` and `line.quality`.

A dot in a name is nothing special — variable names are plain strings, and `target.x` is simply a variable called `target.x`.

The most useful application is diagnosis. Picture not being found? Put this after the check:

```
If  variable  match_score < 0.85
    Note: image not found, best match too weak
End if
```

and read the log.

### Starting values

The interface has **no** field for starting values — every run takes them from the `vars` field in the macro file, and everything else starts at zero.

If you really need them, open the `.json` in a text editor and add:

```json
"vars": { "rounds": 0, "gems": 0 }
```

In practice it's easier to make `Set rounds = 0` the first step. Same result, no hand-editing.

> ⚠️ Variables are **not** kept between runs. Every new run — and every round of loop playback — starts fresh.

---

## 10. Blocks: `If` and `While`

Both work the same way: an opening step, a closing step, contents in between. Like brackets.

### If … Else … End if

```
0  If  image: error_popup ≥ 0.85
1      Click image: ok_button ≥ 0.85
2      Wait 500 ms
3  Else
4      Play events 0…46
5  End if
6  Wait 1000 ms
```

Read it as: if an error popup is on screen, run steps 1–2; otherwise run step 4. Either way, step 6 comes next.

**`Else` is optional.** Often you just want "do this if true":

```
0  If  variable  lives <= 0
1      Note: dead, exiting
2      Quit the app
3  End if
```

### While … End while

```
0  Set  rounds = 0
1  While  variable  rounds < 20
2      Play events 0…46
3      Set  rounds += 1
4  End while
```

How it runs:
1. Reach `While` — test the condition.
2. True → run the contents, hit `End while`, **jump back to step 1** to test again.
3. False → jump straight past `End while`.

If the condition is false from the start, the contents never run **at all**.

### Break

Leaves the **innermost** enclosing loop early:

```
0  While  always
1      Play events 0…46
2      If  image: inventory_full ≥ 0.85
3          Break             ← leave the While
4      End if
5      Wait 2000 ms
6  End while
7  Note: inventory filled up
```

### Nesting

Blocks nest as deep as you like. The indentation is drawn automatically, so the structure is visible at a glance:

```
0  While  variable  rounds < 10
1      If  image: bonus ≥ 0.85
2          Click image: bonus ≥ 0.85
3          Wait 300 ms
4      End if
5      Play events 0…46
6      Set  rounds += 1
7  End while
```

### Rules checked before anything runs

The app won't run a malformed script. Before starting it checks:

| Mistake | Message |
|---|---|
| `If` with no `End if` | `⚠ Unbalanced blocks: #0` |
| `End while` with no `While` | `⚠ Unbalanced blocks: End while #4` |
| A `While` closed by `End if` | `⚠ Unbalanced blocks: While #2` |
| Two `Else` for one `If` | `⚠ Unbalanced blocks: Else #5` |
| `Else` outside any `If` | `⚠ Unbalanced blocks: Else #3` |

While that message is showing, **the script does not execute at all** — not partially, not at all. Fix the blocks.

### Runaway protection

If a script executes 50,000,000 steps in a single run, the engine stops it and logs `script exceeded its step budget`. That's the safety net for a typo like `While rounds < 20` with no `rounds += 1` — it won't leave your machine spinning forever.

---

## 11. Image templates: how to make good ones

A template is a small PNG of the button or icon you want found.

### Step by step

1. Open the game the way it will look while the macro runs.
2. Press `Win+Shift+S` (the Windows snipping tool) and select **just the button**.
3. In Macro Recorder expand **🔎 Image search** and press **📋 Paste**.
4. Press **🔍 Find on screen**. You should get `Found at (x, y) — 0.98`.
5. Press **💾 Save PNG…** and save it into the `templates/` folder under a clear name, e.g. `claim_button.png`.
6. In the script step, type the name into the `Template` field: `claim_button`.

The `templates/` folder sits next to `config.json` — the exact path is shown in the main window under **📁 Files**.

### What makes a good template

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| Crop just the button | Don't capture half the screen |
| Pick something that doesn't change | Don't include timers, counters or animation |
| Aim for 30–150 px per side | Don't use 10×10 — it'll match anything |
| Snip at the resolution the macro will run at | Don't move templates between monitors |
| Verify with **🔍 Find on screen** | Don't assume "it should work" |

### The threshold

| Value | When |
|---|---|
| `1.00` | Pixel-perfect only. Almost never fires in practice |
| `0.90` | Strict. For crisp static graphics |
| **`0.85`** | **The default — start here** |
| `0.75` | Forgiving. For a button that glows or pulses slightly |
| `0.60` | Very forgiving. Expect false matches |

The score is **normalised**, which means overall brightness and contrast don't matter. A template snipped in the game's day theme usually still matches at night.

### The transparency trick

Fully transparent pixels in the PNG are **excluded from the comparison**.

So in any editor (Paint.NET, GIMP, Photoshop) you can erase the background around a round icon to transparency — and it will then be found on any backdrop: grass, stone, water.

### One object, several pictures

A **folder** under `templates/` is a set. Put `normal.png`, `hover.png` and `dark.png` inside `templates/Claim/`, write `Claim` in the step, and all three are tried against the same screenshot; the best one wins, and `target.w`/`target.h` report the size of the variant that actually matched.

The screen is taken once for the whole set, so the extra cost is only the comparisons — but it is linear in the number of variants, which is exactly why a folder wants a **search area** rather than the whole desktop.

Files are tried in alphabetical order, so which variant wins a tie does not depend on the file system.

### The scale it was cut at

A picture snipped on a display at 150 % is half again the size of the same button on a display at 100 %, and no threshold bridges that.

When you press **💾 Save** in the image panel, a small `Name.png.json` is written beside the PNG recording the display scale at that moment. Loading the template rescales it for whatever display it is about to be looked for on.

Templates made before 1.4.0 have no such file, and nothing is guessed for them — they are used exactly as they are.

### Important for scripts

**Try other scales** in the panel applies to the **test button only**; inside a script the search is always at 1:1, with the rescaling above as the answer to a different display.

The **search area** is not panel-only any more — every image step and image condition has its own, and setting it is the single biggest thing you can do for speed. If a scripted search feels slow, tell it where to look before you start shrinking templates.

---

## 12. Three worked examples

### Example A. "Click the button the moment it appears"

Goal: a "Claim" button shows up at unpredictable times. Press it immediately, forever.

You'll need: a `claim.png` template in `templates/`.

```
0  Wait for  image: claim ≥ 0.85  appears  (30000 ms)
1  If        image: claim ≥ 0.85
2      Click image: claim ≥ 0.85
3      Wait 500 ms
4  Else
5      Note: button did not appear within 30 seconds
6  End if
```

Tick **Loop playback** in the main window. The script goes round and round: wait → press → wait → press.

Why the `If` after `Wait for`: on timeout, `Wait for` silently gives up, and without the check step 2 would try to click nothing. `Click image` would also do nothing on its own — but with the `Note` you at least see the problem in the log.

---

### Example B. "Do exactly 20 rounds, then quit"

Goal: replay a recorded farm 20 times and exit, with a pause between rounds.

```
0  Set  rounds = 0
1  While  variable  rounds < 20
2      Play events 0…240  (241/241)
3      Set  rounds += 1
4      Note: round finished
5      Wait 2000 ms
6  End while
7  Note: 20 rounds done
8  Quit the app
```

> 💡 You could do the same with no script at all: untick **Loop playback** and set **Play count: 20**. The script is worth it once you need to check something between rounds.

---

### Example C. "Farm until 500 gems, then shut the PC down"

The realistic scenario. You'll need: a `claim.png` template and a screen region showing the gem counter.

```
0   Set  gems = 0
1   While  variable  gems < 500
2       If  image: error_popup ≥ 0.85
3           Click image: ok_button ≥ 0.85
4           Wait 1000 ms
5       End if
6       Play events 0…240
7       Wait for  image: claim ≥ 0.85  appears  (15000 ms)
8       Click image: claim ≥ 0.85
9       Wait 800 ms
10      Read number (1620,40 300x80) → gems
11      Note: another round done
12  End while
13  Note: 500 gems reached
14  Run  shutdown   /s /t 60
15  Quit the app
```

Walking through it:

- **0** — reset the counter; otherwise it inherits an old value (and before the first `Read number` it's unknown anyway).
- **2–5** — the janitor: if an error popup showed up, close it and carry on. If not, the block is skipped.
- **6** — the actual work: replay the recorded slice.
- **7–8** — wait for the button and press it.
- **10** — read the gem counter off the screen into the variable. Get the region from the **🔤 Text on screen** panel with **⤵ from the panel**.
- **14** — the Windows shutdown command with a 60-second delay. Cancel it by running `shutdown /a` in a terminal.
- **15** — close Macro Recorder itself.

> ⚠️ Note that the shutdown is a `Run` step, **not** the "Action when the limit is hit" setting in the main window. That setting does nothing in script mode.

---

## 13. Debugging: seeing what's going on

A script runs silently. Here are five ways to look inside.

### Method 1. Notes in the log — the main tool

Scatter `Note` steps at the interesting points:

```
0  Note: === round start ===
1  If  image: bonus ≥ 0.85
2      Note: bonus found
3      Click image: bonus ≥ 0.85
4  Else
5      Note: no bonus, skipping
6  End if
```

Then open the log file:

```
<data folder>/logs/macro-recorder.log.2026-08-16
```

The exact data-folder path is shown in the main window under **📁 Files**. Any text editor opens it.

Your notes will be in there, alongside the engine's own entries:

| Log line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `script: your text` | Your `Note` |
| `playing events 0..=240 of 241` | A `Play events` step started |
| `wait timed out` | `Wait for` gave up and moved on |
| `while at #3: condition false, leaving the loop` | The loop ended |
| `ocr read 'Gems: 1,250' [Ui q0.95] -> gems = 1250` | `Read number` worked: what it read, which profile read it, and how well it fits |
| `ocr read '…' does not fit Integer - gems kept` | The reading was the wrong shape, so the variable was left alone |
| `element 'Save' at 812,540 (74x28)` | `Find element` found something |
| `template 'Claim' rescaled 90x30 -> 135x45` | The sidecar said it was cut at a different display scale |
| `template 'claim' could not be loaded` | Template file not found — check the name and `templates/` |
| `ocr failed: …` | Recognition failed; the variable was left alone |
| `script rejected: unbalanced blocks near …` | Blocks don't match up; nothing ran |
| `script exceeded its step budget` | The runaway protection kicked in |

### Method 2. Disable steps instead of deleting them

The **on** checkbox switches a step off temporarily. The line goes ~~struck-through~~ and the engine skips it.

That's how you bisect a problem: disable half the script — still broken? Then it's in the other half.

### Method 3. The "skip step" hotkey

It is **unbound** by default. Bind it under **⌨ Hotkeys → Skip step:** (to `F10`, say).

Now pressing it mid-run abandons the current step and moves to the next one. Invaluable when the script is stuck on a `Wait for` and you want to see what happens afterwards.

### Method 4. Watch where it is looking

Switch on **Show what the script looks at** in **🔎 Image search**. A see-through window appears over everything — it cannot be clicked, and it draws, while the script runs:

- a blue rectangle: where the search was allowed to look;
- a green or red rectangle with a number: what it found, and how sure it was (green means it would pass an ordinary threshold);
- an amber rectangle: where text was read from;
- a violet rectangle: the interface element that was found.

This answers the question a score cannot. A failing search gives you `0.41`, and `0.41` does not say whether it looked in the wrong place, at the wrong size, or at the right thing with a tooltip over it. A rectangle says immediately.

It is a diagnostic, not something to leave on — turn it off when you are done.

### Method 5. Test conditions on their own

Before putting a condition in a script, try it by hand in the main window:

- **image** → **🔎 Image search → 🔍 Find on screen**;
- **text** and **Read number** → **🔤 Text on screen → 🔤 Read now**;
- **pixel** → **🎯 Pixel condition → 🎯 Pick in 3 s**.

If it doesn't work in the panel, it certainly won't work in the script.

## 14. Common traps

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| The script won't start, orange warning at the top | Unbalanced blocks | Count them: every `If` needs an `End if`, every `While` an `End while` |
| The script ends instantly, having done nothing | Every step disabled, or `Quit the app` is at the top | Check the **on** boxes and the step order |
| The image is never found | Template not in `templates/`, a typo in the name, or a different screen resolution | Verify with **🔍 Find on screen**. Look for `template … could not be loaded` in the log |
| The wrong thing gets matched | Threshold too low, template too small | Raise it to 0.90, use a bigger and more distinctive crop |
| `Wait for` doesn't wait, it races ahead | The condition is already true, or the timeout expired | Increase the timeout; check `appears` vs `disappears` |
| The `While` loop never ends | Nothing inside it changes the variable | Add `Set rounds += 1` **inside** the loop |
| A key stays held down | A `press` with no matching `release` | Add the pairing step. `F9` force-releases everything |
| Clicks land in the wrong place | The window moved or the resolution changed | Use `Click image` instead of `Click at`, or turn on window anchoring |
| `Read number` gives 0 | OCR recognised nothing | Verify with **🔤 Read now**. Use a bigger region, add the language pack in Windows |
| `Read number` doesn't change the variable | OCR errored (region under 40×40, for instance) | Enlarge the region. The log will say `ocr failed` |
| The speed slider does nothing | In a script it only affects `Play events` | Edit the values in your `Wait` steps |
| The pixel stop condition never fires | The **🎯 Pixel condition** setting is ignored in script mode | Use a `pixel` condition inside `Wait for` / `If` / `While` |
| The PC doesn't shut down after the time limit | "Action when the limit is hit" is ignored in script mode | Use a `Run` step → `shutdown` with `/s /t 60` |
| The script sits still, status says "Waiting for the window…" | **Target window → Pause while it is not in front** is on | Switch to that window, or untick the box |
| Everything froze, status says "Held" | The app is on another virtual desktop | Go back to the desktop where Macro Recorder lives |
| The exported `.exe` can't find images | Templates weren't shipped with it | Copy the `templates/` folder next to the exported `.exe` |
| The `.ahk` export lost all the logic | Working as intended | Only recorded events are translated to AutoHotkey |

## 15. What scripts can't do

An honest list, so you don't hunt for buttons that aren't there:

- **No text variables.** Numbers only. There's nowhere to keep a string.
- **No arithmetic between variables.** `rounds += 1` is fine; `total = rounds * gems` is not. Variable and constant only.
- **No functions or subroutines.** A repeated chunk has to be duplicated.
- **No `and` / `or` in conditions.** One condition is one test. Combine them by nesting `If`:
  ```
  If  image: A ≥ 0.85
      If  variable  gems > 100
          ...
      End if
  End if
  ```
- **No `else if`.** Nest an `If` inside the `Else`.
- **No waiting for a launched program.** `Run` starts the process and moves straight on.
- **No file, clipboard or network access.**
- **No way to use `match_x` / `match_y` in a `Click at` step.** Those fields are plain numbers; a variable can't go in them. Clicking a found image is what the separate `Click image` step is for.
- **Variables don't survive a restart.** Every run starts fresh.

If you hit this list, what you probably want is AutoHotkey. That's fine: Macro Recorder is designed as a recorder with conditions, not as a programming language.

## 16. What it looks like inside the file

The script is stored inside the macro file (`.json`). Any text editor opens it — edit it there if you prefer.

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "duration_us": 8000000,
  "events": [ ... your recording ... ],
  "script": [
    { "kind": { "SetVar": { "name": "rounds", "op": "Set", "value": 0.0 } }, "enabled": true },
    { "kind": { "While":  { "cond": { "Var": { "name": "rounds", "cmp": "Lt", "value": 20.0 } } } }, "enabled": true },
    { "kind": { "PlayEvents": { "from": 0, "to": 240 } }, "enabled": true },
    { "kind": { "SetVar": { "name": "rounds", "op": "Add", "value": 1.0 } }, "enabled": true },
    { "kind": "EndWhile", "enabled": true }
  ],
  "vars": { "rounds": 0.0 }
}
```

Name mapping:

| In the UI | In the file |
|---|---|
| Play events | `PlayEvents { from, to }` |
| Wait | `Wait { ms }` |
| Wait for | `WaitFor { cond, appear, timeout_ms }` |
| Click image | `ClickImage { template, threshold, button }` |
| Click at | `Click { x, y, button }` |
| Key | `Key { vk, down }` |
| Set | `SetVar { name, op, value }` |
| If / Else / End if | `If { cond }` / `Else` / `EndIf` |
| While / End while / Break | `While { cond }` / `EndWhile` / `Break` |
| Run | `Run { path, args }` |
| Quit the app | `Exit` |
| Note | `Log { text }` |
| Read number | `ReadNumber { x, y, w, h, var }` |

Conditions: `Always`, `Var { name, cmp, value }`, `Image { template, threshold }`, `Pixel { x, y, r, g, b, tol }`, `Window { title }`, `Text { x, y, w, h, needle }`.

Comparisons: `Eq` `Ne` `Lt` `Le` `Gt` `Ge`. Operations: `Set` `Add` `Sub` `Mul`.

> ⚠️ Save broken JSON and the app will refuse to open the file. Keep a copy before editing.
>
> ⚠️ A `.mrz` file is compressed and won't open in a text editor. Re-save it as `.json` first.

## 17. One-page cheat sheet

**Open the script editor:** main window → **✂ Editor** → **✂ Open editor** → **Script** tab

**Add a step:** pick a kind in the dropdown → **Add** (it lands after the selected step)

**Emergency stop:** `F9`

---

**Steps**

```
Play events from…to      replay a slice of the recording
Wait N ms                 just pause
Wait for <condition> appears/disappears (timeout)
Click image <template> <threshold> <button>
Click at X,Y <button>
Key <key> press/release
Set <name> = += -= *= <number>
If <condition> … Else … End if
While <condition> … Break … End while
Run <path> <arguments>
Quit the app
Note <text>
Read number <region> → <variable>
```

**Conditions**

```
always
variable <name> == != < <= > >= <number>
image <template> <threshold 0.30–1.00>
pixel X,Y <colour> <tolerance 0–255>
window <title>
text "word" <region>
```

**The three things people forget most**

1. Every `If` needs an `End if`. Every `While` needs an `End while`.
2. Something inside a `While` must change the variable in its condition.
3. Every `Key … press` needs a `Key … release`.

**Threshold:** start at `0.85`; not found → `0.75`; matching the wrong thing → `0.90`.

**Log:** `<data folder>/logs/macro-recorder.log.YYYY-MM-DD` — the folder path is shown under **📁 Files**.
